# Welcome to the Sight &amp; Sound GitHub!

Nice to meet you! If you're not familiar with Sight &amp; Sound and our mission, check us out at [sight-sound.com](https://sight-sound.com). Here on GitHub, you'll find the home of the Sight &amp; Sound Development Team. We develop the core ticketing systems (and various other custom systems) here at Sight &amp; Sound. Take a look at the projects we have developed and released open source, and some awesome open source projects that we contribute to!
